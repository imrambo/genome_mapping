Read mapping builds with SCons

Map FASTQ reads against an assembly (e.g. genome) in FASTA format. 
This script will pair up groups of FASTQ files and map them to an assembly. 

###############
Getting Started
###############
Prerequisites: conda, python=3.5, bwa, samtools=1.8, biopython, python-magic 

I recommend using a conda environment (either with Miniconda3 or Anaconda) to run this script. You can create the 
conda environment using the conda_env_genome_map_scons.yml provided in the repository:

conda env create -f conda_env_genome_map_scons.yml



###############
Running the script
###############
To see the available options for scons, as well as the build, run this in the 
same directory as the SConstruct file

scons -h

Be sure to use all the included options:
scons --fastq_dir=<path to directory containing fastq files> --assembly=<path to assembly you are mapping to> --outdir=<output directory> --sampleids=<sample id patterns of FASTQ files> --align_thread=10 --samsort_thread=2 --samsort_mem=10G --nslice=1200 --tmpdir=<directory for temporary files>

By default, scons will create a build in the same directory as the SConstruct. 
Include the --rm_local_build option to delete this build.
